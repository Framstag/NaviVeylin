# agent-issue-loop — deltas

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A review's task states what the round may run, and quotes the gate instead of running it

The task a review round is given SHALL state, before the items it judges: the inputs the round reads, the acts
it SHALL NOT perform — running the gate and running a test suite among them — the wall-clock bound it runs
under, and the shape of its answer. A green gate result SHALL be quoted from the evidence the change carries,
never reproduced. A diff review SHALL be stated to be a reading task, which is what the model for it is chosen
on.

#### Scenario: The round's task names the gate and the suite it may not run

- **WHEN** the run renders the reviewer's task for an item
- **THEN** the text carries the inputs the round reads, the read-only list with the gate, the test suite and
  the network named in it, the wall-clock bound the run itself enforces on the child, the rule that a green
  gate is quoted from the evidence, and that the review is a reading task — and item 3 of the eight asks
  whether the evidence shows a real execution rather than inviting one
- **Case**: `prompt#reviewerIsBoundedToReading`

#### Scenario: A reviewer a session starts itself is handed the same task text

- **WHEN** a session that changes this project spawns its own reviewer, outside the loop
- **THEN** the project's iteration protocol names the loop's reviewer task as the text to hand over, and states
  the bound that task carries — so the same round is bounded whether the run or a session started it
- **Case**: `prompt#iterationProtocolHandsTheReviewerTheSameSkeleton`
