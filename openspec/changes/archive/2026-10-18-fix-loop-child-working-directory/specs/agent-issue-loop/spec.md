# fix-loop-child-working-directory — deltas

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Each item is worked by a fresh process, reviewed by a different one

An item SHALL be worked by an agent process that starts fresh, given a prepared package describing the
item as data, and SHALL then be reviewed by a second, fresh process that is not the one that wrote the
change.

#### Scenario: The item arrives as a prepared package

- **WHEN** an agent process is started for an item
- **THEN** it receives a prepared package — the item's claim and evidence, the specification passage and
  the acceptance condition — and the item's own text is passed only inside a delimited data field

#### Scenario: A process runs where the project's own policy applies

- **WHEN** an agent process is started for an item
- **THEN** it is started in the project and told by path which tree it changes, so the project's own
  policy governs the process, and the package it is handed, the evidence directory it writes and the tree
  it changes all lie inside the boundary the process may reach

#### Scenario: A process that writes outside its tree is caught

- **WHEN** an agent process changes the project's own tree while an item is in flight
- **THEN** the item is recorded as blocked with that reason and none of that write is committed into the
  item's change, because the worktree is the only tree a phase may write

#### Scenario: The reviewer is not the writer

- **WHEN** a review is run
- **THEN** it is a separate process from the one that produced the work

#### Scenario: A reviewer that writes is discarded

- **WHEN** the working tree changed while the reviewer ran
- **THEN** that review round is discarded with a reason, because a reviewer that wrote cannot have been
  the reviewer

#### Scenario: Review rounds are bounded

- **WHEN** a change fails its second review round
- **THEN** the item is recorded as needing a decision and no further round is attempted
