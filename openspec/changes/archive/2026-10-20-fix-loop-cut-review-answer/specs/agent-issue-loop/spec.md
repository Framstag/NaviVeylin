# agent-issue-loop — deltas

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A review finding is blocking or it is not, and the round counts

A review round SHALL grade every finding as **blocking** or **note**, and state one machine-readable count of
its blocking findings (`LOOP-BLOCKING: <n>`). Blocking means the contract is contradicted, a scenario is not
exercised by the case that names it, or the gate or red-case evidence is missing or false; a note is anything
the change does not depend on. The run SHALL refuse on that count, not on the verdict's word.

#### Scenario: A finding that blocks nothing does not refuse the round

- **WHEN** a review round reports `VERDICT: FAIL` and counts zero blocking findings
- **THEN** the change is not refused: the item closes, exactly one round was taken, and the round's `NOTE:`
  findings are recorded on the item — in its closure comment and in its state note — so a note is recorded
  rather than absorbed
- **AND** a report that also carries `LOOP-CORRECTIONS-ONLY: yes` earns no extra round for it, because that line
  describes the shape of a refusal and there is no refusal to describe
- **Case**: `run#aZeroBlockingRefusalClosesWithItsNotes`

#### Scenario: A blocking finding refuses the change as it always has

- **WHEN** a review round counts one or more blocking findings
- **THEN** the round is a refusal: another round is taken within the budget, and a second refusal records the item
  `blocked`, escalates it and writes the reviewer's `LOOP-DECISION` into the escalation
- **Case**: `run#aBlockingRefusalStillTakesTheRoundTwoPath`

#### Scenario: A report that states no count is read as a refusal

- **WHEN** a reviewer report carries no `LOOP-BLOCKING` line, as every report written before this rule does
- **THEN** the round is read as blocking whatever its verdict says, because a run cannot tell an older review from
  a quiet one, so no review can pass by saying nothing
- **AND** a report that carries no closing `VERDICT:` line either is not read by this rule at all: it arrived
  cut, and the retry below establishes whether there was anything to grade
- **Case**: `run#reviewRoundsCapAtTwo`

#### Scenario: An unchanged pass still passes

- **WHEN** a review round reports `VERDICT: PASS` with no count line or a count of zero
- **THEN** the item closes exactly as before, with no notes recorded and no second round taken
- **Case**: `run#metricsRecordedPerItem`

#### Scenario: A report that arrived cut is retried, not read as a refusal

An answer can be lost between the child and the file the run decides from: on 2026-10-20 an item's round-2
report ended mid-word (`… and the post-restore gre`, no `VERDICT:`, no final newline) while its own text
recorded all seven scenarios PASS, and the run blocked and escalated work that had passed (issue #224). The shape
of the answer is the discriminator, and it is checkable without a model: the child's adapter prints one newline
after every answer it hands the run, and the prompt asks for the closing line last.

- **WHEN** a review round's report does not carry the `VERDICT: PASS|FAIL` line its prompt asks for last, or does
  not end with the newline the adapter prints after an answer, and the round's child was not ended by the run's
  own wall-clock (`LOOP-TIMEOUT`)
- **THEN** the run states that the answer was cut short, naming the report's last line, and asks the same round
  once more — the same prompt contract and the same diff, written to `reviewer-prompt-<n>-retry.md`, with the cut
  attempt kept beside the retry as `reviewer-report-<n>.md` and `reviewer-report-<n>-retry.md` — and the retried
  answer decides the round, so the retry spends no second review round and no worker round and the item is not
  escalated
- **Case**: `run#aCutReportIsRetriedInsteadOfRefused`

#### Scenario: Two cut answers in one round block it as the transport's fault

- **WHEN** the retried answer is cut as well
- **THEN** the item is recorded `blocked` with the reason that the reviewer's report was cut short twice — that
  round produced no verdict at all, so no reviewer refused the change — no worker round is taken for it, and no
  review-failure marker is written into the change on the branch, because a later run must not refuse to adopt a
  change no reviewer refused
- **Case**: `run#aReportCutTwiceBlocksAsTheTransportsFault`
