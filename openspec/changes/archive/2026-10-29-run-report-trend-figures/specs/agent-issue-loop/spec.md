# Spec Delta — agent-issue-loop

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The report states whether the loop is getting better

A run's report SHALL also state what one run cannot show: a run that cost what the last one cost prints the same
shapes as one that is improving. It SHALL total the share of items whose review round 1 ended in a pass — read
from the verdict the round recorded, never from the round count alone — and the item wall median, minimum and
maximum, from the state it already reads, and SHALL name where the one figure that state does not hold is read
(issue #247).

#### Scenario: The two figures the state holds are totalled

- **WHEN** a run's report is printed for a state whose items record the verdict their last review round ended on
- **THEN** it prints the share of the items whose recorded verdict is a pass at round 1 against the items whose
  round ended in a verdict, and the median, minimum and maximum of the item wall times, both over the run's own
  items, and it says so, because a rate is not settled by one run
- **Case**: `report#trendFiguresFromState`

#### Scenario: A refused round 1 is not a pass

A round's count says the round was attempted, not how it ended, so an item whose round 1 refused and which the
run then blocked carries the same count as one whose round 1 passed.

- **WHEN** an item's round 1 ended in a refusal and it is the last round the item got, or the round after it
  passed
- **THEN** the first counts as a refusal and the second as no first-round pass, because the verdict decides and
  the count does not
- **Case**: `report#trendFiguresFromState`

#### Scenario: A round that ended without a verdict is in no rate

- **WHEN** a round ended without a verdict — the reviewer's answer was cut, the run's clock ended it, it wrote, or
  the state was written before the verdict was recorded — while another round of the run did end in one
- **THEN** that item is named apart as undecided and is in neither the numerator nor the denominator, and a state
  whose items carry no verdict at all prints `-` with the reason instead of a rate
- **Case**: `report#trendFiguresFromState`, `report#noRoundOrWallPrintsDashNotZero`

#### Scenario: A never-reviewed item is not a refused round

- **WHEN** an item ended before a review round ran — the run blocked it, or review was off — and its record holds
  `reviewRounds` 0
- **THEN** that item is counted as never reviewed and is not in the denominator of the round-1 pass rate
- **Case**: `report#trendFiguresFromState`

#### Scenario: A figure nobody measured prints as absent, not as zero

- **WHEN** no item of the run recorded a wall time
- **THEN** the report prints `-` with the reason beside it rather than a zero that reads as a measurement that was
  made
- **Case**: `report#noRoundOrWallPrintsDashNotZero`

#### Scenario: The figure the state does not hold is named where it is

- **WHEN** the report prints the number of landings that reddened `main`
- **THEN** it names that no state and no commit records which landing merged, and where a caller reads it, and it
  makes no tracker read of its own — the report is still built from the state file and from git
- **Case**: `report#landingsNamedNotInvented`
