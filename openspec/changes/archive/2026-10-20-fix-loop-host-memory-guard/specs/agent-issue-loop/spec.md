## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: One command starts a budgeted run, with no dialogue

A run SHALL be started by one command whose budget is supplied as arguments and recorded, and SHALL
require no interactive answer, so that the same run can be repeated and audited.

#### Scenario: The budget is arguments, not a prompt

- **WHEN** a run is started
- **THEN** the item cap, the time budget, whether a review is taken and whether closure is allowed are
  arguments whose effective values are recorded and printed in the run's header

#### Scenario: The run stops on its own authority

- **WHEN** the item cap is reached, the time budget is spent, the queue is empty, two items in a row were
  blocked, the remaining time cannot pay for another item, or the host has less available memory than the
  recorded floor
- **THEN** the run stops without needing a further decision

#### Scenario: The floor the run refuses by is what its own items cost

A constant floor could not tell a 100-minute item (#126, 2026-10-19) from a 12-minute one, so it admitted the
first with 45 minutes left and refused 28 minutes of cheap work after it (issue #206).

- **WHEN** the remaining time is compared against the floor, and the run has finished at least one item whose
  wall time it recorded (`done --wall SECONDS`)
- **THEN** the floor is derived from those recorded wall times — their median minutes times the 1.5 spread the
  measured costs show, rounded up to the whole minute — and is never below the configured
  `LOOP_ITEM_FLOOR_MINUTES`, and the refusal names the floor, the median, how many finished items it came from
  and the configured minimum, e.g. `only 28 min left, below the 90 min floor for the next item (median 60 min
  over 3 finished items, configured minimum 45)`
- **Case**: `state#floorIsDerivedFromTheFinishedItemsWallTimes`

#### Scenario: A run with no measurement keeps the configured minimum

- **WHEN** no finished item of the run records a wall time — the run has just started, or every item so far
  was recorded without `--wall`
- **THEN** the floor is the configured `LOOP_ITEM_FLOOR_MINUTES`, and the refusal names that value together
  with the reason no measurement was used, rather than implying a measurement it does not have
- **Case**: `state#floorWithNoHistoryIsTheConfiguredMinimum`

#### Scenario: A child that outlasts the configured wall-clock is ended and recorded

The budget is consulted between items, so a child process is the one place a spent budget could not be
noticed: the run waited for it with no limit, and a gate that never returns could spend the whole run inside
one wait.

- **WHEN** an agent process runs longer than the configured child wall-clock
  (`LOOP_CHILD_MAX_SECONDS`, default 2700 s = 45 min)
- **THEN** the run ends that process and every process it started, appends one machine-readable line to the
  report it was writing (`LOOP-TIMEOUT: the child exceeded <n> s …`), and returns a status that is not the
  child's own, so the item is recorded `blocked` with that transcript and the run goes on to its next stop
  condition instead of spending its clock in one wait
- **Case**: `run#childOutlastingTheWallClockIsBlocked`

#### Scenario: A run is recorded

- **WHEN** a run ends
- **THEN** a report exists naming each item, its verdict, its wall time, its review rounds and what it
  closed, so the run justifies itself with numbers

#### Scenario: The host a run works on is read and named

The budget had no term for the machine: on 2026-10-19 the same 5 680 tests took 3m47s on a quiet host and 30
minutes inside one Gradle task at 194 MB free and 18 GB of swap, so the run's `wallSeconds` measured the
desktop session (issue #209).

- **WHEN** a run is started, and the host publishes the memory it has available in the file the configured
  key names
- **THEN** the run's header prints the available memory in MiB beside the budget and beside the floor it is
  compared against, so a run's numbers can be read against the host it ran on
- **Case**: `run#hostAboveTheFloorRunsTheItem`

#### Scenario: A host below the floor is reported instead of spent

- **WHEN** the available memory read before an item's first agent process is started is below the recorded
  floor (`LOOP_MIN_FREE_MIB`, default 1024 MiB)
- **THEN** no agent process is started and no branch is created for the item, the item is recorded `blocked`
  with the measurement and the floor it was compared against, and the run stops with that shortfall as its
  stop reason — a run on a starved host cannot become productive by taking the next item either
- **Case**: `run#hostBelowTheFloorBlocksTheItemAndStops`

#### Scenario: A host that publishes no reading is not refused

A check that cannot be made is not a refusal: the engine has to run in a container without procfs, or on a
host that keeps the number somewhere else.

- **WHEN** the file the configured key names does not exist, or carries no `MemAvailable` value
- **THEN** the check passes, the item's child is started as it always was, and the header says the reading is
  unavailable instead of inventing a number
- **Case**: `run#hostWithoutTheReadingPasses`
