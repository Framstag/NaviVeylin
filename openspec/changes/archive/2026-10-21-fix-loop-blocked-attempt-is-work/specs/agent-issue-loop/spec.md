# agent-issue-loop — deltas

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Version control belongs to the run's script, not to the agent

The run SHALL create and manage the working tree and the branch of each item itself, and no phase of an
item SHALL be able to invoke version control on its own behalf. A previous attempt's branch SHALL be decided by
what it *carries*: a branch whose attempt **finished** — one archived change of its own, added by a commit that
names its issue — SHALL be merged and its item closed by the run, or, when it is not admissible for adoption,
SHALL be refused and escalated as a decision; a branch that carries commits and no archived change of its own
SHALL NOT be a decision: its commits SHALL be kept under a name the run gives them and the item SHALL be worked.

#### Scenario: One working tree per run

- **WHEN** a run starts
- **THEN** it prepares one working tree for the whole run and seeds it with what the project's build and
  test need, so the cold cost is paid once
- **Case**: `worktree#seedsAllFourInputs`

#### Scenario: One branch per item, from the run's base

- **WHEN** an item starts
- **THEN** it is worked on its own branch from the base commit the run recorded
- **Case**: `worktree#oneBranchPerItemOffTheBase`

#### Scenario: A commit carries the run's own identity

- **WHEN** the run commits an item's work on a machine with no `user.name` or `user.email` configured
- **THEN** both commits carry the identity the run already acts as — the login its own gate preflight
  resolved, as that login's noreply address — so the run never depends on an ambient git identity and never
  invents one, and a login that cannot be resolved stops the run with a named reason
- **Case**: `run#commitsWithoutAnAmbientIdentity`

#### Scenario: A branch that carries no work of its own is reused

- **WHEN** an item starts and a branch of that item's name already exists, and every commit on it is
  already in the run's base history
- **THEN** the item is worked on that branch, started from the run's base, so an item a previous run left
  blocked can be taken up again
- **Case**: `worktree#reusesABranchThatCarriesNoWorkOfItsOwn`

#### Scenario: A branch that carries a previous attempt is refused, named and recorded

- **WHEN** an item's branch carries a commit the run's base does not have — whether the run learns it when the
  item starts, or the pre-screen asks git for it before any item is picked, on the item's branch-name prefix
  because the slug is not known before the title is read — and the branch adds an archived change of its own
  that is not admissible for adoption (no green verification record, or the reviewer's refusal of that change)
- **THEN** the item is refused with the branch and the commits it carries named, and it is recorded as
  awaiting a decision before a budget slot is spent on it — in the run's own exclusion list and on the item,
  with the branch as the evidence — because a finished attempt's change is never thrown away and a refusal is
  never silent
- **Case**: `prescreen#aFinishedAttemptBranchIsADecision`, `worktree#refusesABranchCarryingAPreviousAttempt`,
  `run#leftoverBranchIsRecordedNotDropped`

#### Scenario: A finished attempt's branch is merged and its item closed

- **WHEN** an item's branch carries a commit the run's base does not have, and that branch adds exactly one
  archived change **of its own** — the commit that added it names `(#<issue>)` — whose verification record is
  green — learned either when the item starts or when the pre-screen records the branch as an exclusion
- **THEN** the branch's commits are merged onto the base, the base the run recorded advances to the merge, the
  item is closed with the branch, its commits and the evidence it was checked for named in the run's own record
  and report, and no budget slot is spent on a fresh attempt — so a finished attempt is not treated as a blocked
  one, and a change another item's commit added does not make this branch adoptable
- **Case**: `run#mergesAFinishedAttemptAndClosesTheItem`

#### Scenario: A change another item's commit added does not make the branch adoptable

- **WHEN** the run is asked to adopt a branch whose only archived change was added by a commit that names
  another issue
- **THEN** nothing is merged and the refusal names the missing input — a single archived change of this branch's
  own — rather than a change the branch never wrote
- **Case**: `worktree#doesNotAdoptAChangeCreditedToAnotherIssue`

#### Scenario: A branch without a green verification is not merged

- **WHEN** the run learns of a previous attempt's branch that carries a commit the base does not have but whose
  archived change has no green verification record
- **THEN** the branch is not touched and the refusal names what it looked for, so a blocked attempt's branch is
  neither merged nor closed and its decision stays the owner's
- **Case**: `run#doesNotMergeAnAttemptWithoutAGreenVerification`

#### Scenario: A stale base stops the next item

- **WHEN** the main branch has advanced past the run's base commit
- **THEN** the next item is refused and both commits are named, rather than building on a tree nobody
  reviewed
- **Case**: `worktree#refusesWhenMainAdvanced`

#### Scenario: Nothing is pushed or opened by default

- **WHEN** a run does not ask to publish
- **THEN** no push and no change request happens, whatever the items did
- **Case**: `worktree#noPushWithoutTheFlag`

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A blocked attempt's branch is kept under a name of the run's own, and its item is worked

An item whose branch carries commits the base does not have and adds no archived change of its own SHALL not be
recorded as awaiting a decision. Its branch SHALL be renamed outside the `fix/issue-<N>-` prefix, so its commits
stay reachable and no later run reads it as an attempt, and the item SHALL be worked on a fresh branch. A branch
the run cannot classify SHALL be the owner's, never work.

#### Scenario: The pre-screen queues the item and names the branch it will set aside

- **WHEN** an eligible item's branch carries commits the base does not have and adds no archived change of its
own — a change another item's commit added does not count
- **THEN** the verdict is not a decision, the item is queued as work, and the run's record names the branch as
  the evidence and the set-aside as the action
- **Case**: `prescreen#aBlockedAttemptBranchIsWork`

#### Scenario: The start keeps the commits and works the item

- **WHEN** an item starts and its branch is in that state, whether the branch was there before the run or
  appeared while the run was open
- **THEN** the branch is renamed under the run's leftover prefix, its commit is still reachable there, the item
  is worked on a fresh branch from the run's base, and the run prints the rename instead of refusing
- **Case**: `worktree#setsAsideABlockedAttemptAndStartsFresh`,
  `run#branchThatAppearsWhileTheRunIsOpenIsSetAside`
