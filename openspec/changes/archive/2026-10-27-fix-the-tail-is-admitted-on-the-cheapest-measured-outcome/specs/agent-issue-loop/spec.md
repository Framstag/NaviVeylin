## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: One command starts a budgeted run, with no dialogue

A run SHALL be started by one command whose budget is supplied as arguments and recorded, and SHALL
require no interactive answer, so that the same run can be repeated and audited.

#### Scenario: The budget is arguments, not a prompt

- **WHEN** a run is started
- **THEN** the item cap, the time budget, whether a review is taken and whether closure is allowed are
  arguments whose effective values are recorded and printed in the run's header

#### Scenario: The run stops on its own authority

- **WHEN** the item cap is reached, the time budget is spent, the queue is empty, two items in a row were
  blocked, the remaining time cannot pay for another item, or the host has less available memory than the
  recorded floor
- **THEN** the run stops without needing a further decision

#### Scenario: The floor the run refuses by is what its own items cost

A constant floor could not tell a 100-minute item (#126, 2026-10-19) from a 12-minute one, so it admitted the
first with 45 minutes left and refused 28 minutes of cheap work after it (issue #206). One constant for every
item made a run of 10-15 min skips stop up to ~50 min before its deadline (issue #674), so the floor follows the
cheapest item the run has measured.

- **WHEN** the remaining time is compared against the floor, and the run has finished at least one item whose
  wall time it recorded (`done --wall SECONDS`)
- **THEN** the floor is derived from the **cheapest** recorded wall time — its minutes times the 1.5 spread the
  measured costs show, rounded up to the whole minute — and is not raised to `LOOP_ITEM_FLOOR_MINUTES`, so a
  cheap tail is admitted and a single expensive item among cheap ones does not refuse it; the refusal names the
  floor, the cheapest wall time, how many finished items it came from and the configured minimum, e.g. `only 28
  min left, below the 90 min floor for the next item (cheapest 60 min over 3 finished items, configured minimum
  65)`
- **Case**: `state#floorIsDerivedFromTheFinishedItemsWallTimes`


#### Scenario: A run with no measurement keeps the configured minimum

- **WHEN** no finished item of the run records a wall time — the run has just started, or every item so far
  was recorded without `--wall`
- **THEN** the floor is the configured `LOOP_ITEM_FLOOR_MINUTES`, and the refusal names that value together
  with the reason no measurement was used, rather than implying a measurement it does not have
- **Case**: `state#floorWithNoHistoryIsTheConfiguredMinimum`

#### Scenario: A child that outlasts the configured wall-clock is ended and recorded

The budget is consulted between items, so a child process is the one place a spent budget could not be
noticed: the run waited for it with no limit, and a gate that never returns could spend the whole run inside
one wait. The bound is not one constant for every item: what a child is given follows what its own
item's gate costs, which a profile records as a number, and an item was ended 8 s after its green
gate had been written for want of that number (issue #663).

- **WHEN** an agent process runs longer than the child wall-clock the run gives it — the larger of the recorded
  floor (`LOOP_CHILD_MAX_SECONDS`, default 2700 s = 45 min) and what one item's gate owes
  (`LOOP_ITEM_GATE_SECONDS`, which a project without a gate leaves out)
- **THEN** the run ends that process and every process it started, appends one machine-readable line to the
  report it was writing (`LOOP-TIMEOUT: the child exceeded <n> s …`), and returns a status that is not the
  child's own, so the item is recorded `blocked` with that transcript and the run goes on to its next stop
  condition instead of spending its clock in one wait
- **Case**: `run#childOutlastingTheWallClockIsBlocked`

#### Scenario: A child that never started is the run's fault, not the item's

A non-zero status alone cannot tell a child whose argv the environment refused from a child that worked the
item and failed: on 2026-10-20 both children of that run died in under 4 s with the same 35-byte complaint,
and the run recorded two items `blocked`, escalated both with `agent/needs-decision` and `status/on-hold`, and
stopped on "two consecutive items ended blocked" 3 minutes into an 8 h budget — two questions nobody had asked, and two
of the run's three decision slots (issue #212).

- **WHEN** an agent process ends with a non-zero status, wrote no verdict line, was not ended by the run's own
  wall-clock, and left the item's tree at the run's base commit
- **THEN** the run records that once as its own stop reason, naming the child's own last line, and stops
  without escalating an item: no item record is written for it, no decision label and no hold reach it, and it
  is left as its owner set it — `status/open` and no `agent/needs-decision` — because no part of it was read
- **Case**: `run#childThatNeverStartedIsTheRunsFault`

#### Scenario: A run is recorded

- **WHEN** a run ends
- **THEN** a report exists naming each item, its verdict, its wall time, its spend, its review rounds and what
  it closed, so the run justifies itself with numbers — every item's row carries the wall time the run recorded
  for it, the tools its children called with their count, the tokens they used with their cost and the largest
  context they reached, and, when the item's result is not a closure, the reason the item recorded, and the
  columns the report already had keep their name and their order
- **Case**: `report#wallTimeAndReasonInTheTable`

#### Scenario: An item's spend is read from the child's own stream

The agent reports its tool calls, its tokens and its cost in its event stream, and the loop used to start it in
a mode that discards the stream, so the one measurement of spend that exists was never read (issue #211).

- **WHEN** a child's process produced an event stream and the item is recorded with it
- **THEN** the item's metrics hold the count of each tool its children called, the tokens they used summed over
  their responses (each response counted once, at its last usage record, not once per streamed update), what
  those tokens cost, and the largest context any of them reached — the biggest input-plus-cache-read of a
  response, or a compaction's `tokensBefore` when the context was compacted — and the row the report prints
  shows them in the `tools`, `tokens` and `context` columns
- **Case**: `run#childUsageIsRecordedPerItem`

#### Scenario: Nothing reported is printed as zero

A provider that streams no usage leaves zeros behind, and a zero in a column of numbers reads as a measurement
that was made.

- **WHEN** an item's stream holds no usage record, holds only zeroed ones, or no stream was written at all —
  a project whose agent command prints plain text is the third case
- **THEN** the report prints `-` in the `tools`, `tokens` and `context` columns rather than `0`, the item is
  worked and recorded exactly as before, and nothing about the run depends on the stream existing
- **Case**: `report#zeroUsagePrintsDashNotZero`, `run#plainTextChildStillReports`

#### Scenario: The report names the actions the caller owes

The report is read instead of the tracker, so a list of ids is not an answer: a decision without its question,
a branch without its owner, a gate without its log and a kept worktree without its path send the caller back
to `gh` to reconstruct what the run already knew (issue #208). A branch is named here by what it **carries**:
the loop lands an item's work as a commit of its own, so a branch whose patches the base already holds has
nothing to land (issue #228).

- **WHEN** a run ends holding a decision it escalated, a branch that carries a patch the run's base does not
  have, a kept worktree, an item whose gate never completed, a citation the pre-screen refused, or the work an
  ended child left as a patch
- **THEN** the report prints one named action for each: the decision with the question the run wrote beside
  it — or, where the state does not hold that text, where the question is (`gh issue view <n>`) rather than an
  invented one — the branch with the patches it carries and the item that owns it, the kept worktree with its
  path, the item's transcript for the gate that never completed, the repair command for the refused
  citation, and the recovery line naming the patch an ended child's work was kept in (issue #674)
- **Case**: `report#actionsNameDecisionAndBranch`

#### Scenario: A branch whose patches are in the base is not an action

- **WHEN** a run ends and one of the item branches it sees carries no patch the base does not have — every one
  of its commits was landed, or re-landed, as a commit of the loop's own
- **THEN** the action list does not name that branch, and its `none` line is printed when nothing else is owed,
  so a leftover cannot be read as work a caller has to land
- **Case**: `report#landedBranchIsNoAction`

#### Scenario: An action list is empty only when the state says so

- **WHEN** no decision, no branch carrying an unlanded patch, no kept worktree, no incomplete gate, no refused
  citation and no leftover patch is recorded — or when the state names any one of them
- **THEN** the report prints the action list heading with `none` and what that covers in the first case, and
  never prints `none` in the second, so an empty list cannot hide a branch that carries work
- **Case**: `report#emptyRunSaysNone`

#### Scenario: The host a run works on is read and named

The budget had no term for the machine: on 2026-10-19 the same 5 680 tests took 3m47s on a quiet host and 30
minutes inside one Gradle task at 194 MB free and 18 GB of swap, so the run's `wallSeconds` measured the
desktop session (issue #209).

- **WHEN** a run is started, and the host publishes the memory it has available in the file the configured
  key names
- **THEN** the run's header prints the available memory in MiB beside the budget and beside the floor it is
  compared against, so a run's numbers can be read against the host it ran on
- **Case**: `run#hostAboveTheFloorRunsTheItem`

#### Scenario: A host below the floor is reported instead of spent

- **WHEN** the available memory read before an item's first agent process is started is below the recorded
  floor (`LOOP_MIN_FREE_MIB`, default 1024 MiB)
- **THEN** no agent process is started and no branch is created for the item, the item is recorded `blocked`
  with the measurement and the floor it was compared against, and the run stops with that shortfall as its
  stop reason — a run on a starved host cannot become productive by taking the next item either
- **Case**: `run#hostBelowTheFloorBlocksTheItemAndStops`

#### Scenario: A host that publishes no reading is not refused

A check that cannot be made is not a refusal: the engine has to run in a container without procfs, or on a
host that keeps the number somewhere else.

- **WHEN** the file the configured key names does not exist, or carries no `MemAvailable` value
- **THEN** the check passes, the item's child is started as it always was, and the header says the reading is
  unavailable instead of inventing a number
- **Case**: `run#hostWithoutTheReadingPasses`

#### Scenario: The bound a child is given is what one item's own gate costs

Measured 2026-10-26 (issue #663) on a `tools/loop/**` item: gate round 1 (red) 957 s, one focused falsification
suite 233 s, gate round 2 (green) 972 s and 542 s of reading, edit, evidence, archive and report — 2 704 s
against the 2 700 s the constant allowed, so the run ended the child 8 s after its green `gate-summary.xml` was
written; two more items ended the same way the same day with their work on disk.

- **WHEN** a child is started and the profile records what one item's gate owes (`LOOP_ITEM_GATE_SECONDS`)
- **THEN** the run gives the child the larger of that number and `LOOP_CHILD_MAX_SECONDS`, the header names the
  bound it gave, and a `LOOP-TIMEOUT` line names the same number — and a profile that records no gate cost keeps
  the floor
- **Case**: `run#theChildCapIsNeverBelowWhatOneItemsGateOwes`


### Requirement: Both clocks a run refuses by hold what one item's gate owes

The profile SHALL record what one item's gate owes, and the child's wall-clock bound SHALL NOT be recorded below
it: a bound smaller than an item's own gate ends work the run has already decided it can pay for. The configured
`LOOP_ITEM_FLOOR_MINUTES` SHALL NOT be recorded below it either, because that value is the whole floor of a run
with no measurement. Once a run has measured an item, the floor follows the cheapest measured outcome regardless
of what one item's gate owes — the accepted exposure being an item started in that tail, which the run's own
deadline ends and leaves for the next run with its work kept (issue #674).

#### Scenario: The child's bound follows what one item's gate owes

- **WHEN** the profile records `LOOP_ITEM_GATE_SECONDS` and a child wall-clock floor below it
- **THEN** the run gives each child the larger of the two, so an item owing a red round and a green one is not ended
  inside its own cost
- **Case**: `run#theChildCapIsNeverBelowWhatOneItemsGateOwes`

#### Scenario: The item floor is not below what one item's gate owes

- **WHEN** the profile records `LOOP_ITEM_GATE_SECONDS` and an `LOOP_ITEM_FLOOR_MINUTES` whose minutes are fewer than
  it, or records a floor that is not a number
- **THEN** the suite fails naming both numbers, because a run with no measurement would start an item that pays for
  its gate and loses the phases after a green round — while a derived floor below the gate's cost is the accepted
  exposure of a cheap tail and is asserted by `state#floorIsDerivedFromTheFinishedItemsWallTimes`
- **Case**: `state#theItemFloorIsOnlyBelowWhatOneItemsGateOwes`

### Requirement: A child the run ended itself leaves no commit

The run SHALL commit an item's tree only after the child that produced it has finished by its own exit. A child
the run ended — the wall-clock cap's status, or the `LOOP-TIMEOUT` line its transcript carries — SHALL leave the
branch as it stood: the item is recorded blocked with that transcript, and the tree is kept exactly as the child
left it, because nothing is discarded unrecorded: `--reset-worktree` discards it, and so does this run before it
starts its next item, the patch having been written first. It holds for the rework worker a refusing review
round starts as well. The tree that child left SHALL be readable without the tree itself: before the run moves to
its next item, the changes it left — the tracked diff and each untracked file — SHALL be written to
`<item dir>/leftover-from-killed-run.patch`, and the transcript the ended child leaves SHALL carry a
`LOOP-LEFTOVERS:` line naming that file. The item's own state record SHALL name that file as well, so the report
can point a caller at the work an ended child left (issue #674).

An item whose child was ended by the **run's own deadline** SHALL NOT be escalated as a decision about the item:
the clock that cut it is the run's budget, not a finding, so no decision label is written for it and the item is
left for the next run. That holds for every child an item starts — its worker, the rework worker a refusing round
starts, and the reviewer of a review round — and the run SHALL take no further pass over the queue once the
deadline has ended one, because a pass that admitted work the spent budget cannot pay would name a decision about
the item the clock cut. A child the item's own wall-clock cap ended is unchanged and is escalated.

#### Scenario: A worker the cap ends leaves the branch at the base

- **WHEN** the wall-clock cap ends an item's worker and that worker has left changes in the change root
- **THEN** the run commits none of them — the change root's `HEAD` is still the base commit — the item is recorded
  `blocked` with its `LOOP-TIMEOUT` transcript, the tree still carries what the child left (kept, not discarded),
  and the run's own line says the commit was skipped
- **Case**: `run#treeOfAChildTheCapEndedIsNotCommitted`

#### Scenario: The cap ends the rework worker of a refusing review round

- **WHEN** a review round refuses the change and the wall-clock cap ends the rework worker that round starts, after
  that worker has written into the change root
- **THEN** the run commits none of it — the branch carries only what the item's own worker had already earned — the
  item is recorded `blocked` with the round's `LOOP-TIMEOUT` transcript, the tree still carries what that worker
  left, and the blocked reason names the tree it did not commit
- **Case**: `run#treeOfACapEndedReworkOfARefusingRoundIsNotCommitted`

#### Scenario: The changes a cap-ended child left are kept as a patch

- **WHEN** the wall-clock cap ends an item's worker that has left modifications and an untracked file in the tree
- **THEN** `<item dir>/leftover-from-killed-run.patch` exists, carries the worker's modifications (staged and
  unstaged, against `HEAD`) and that untracked file's content, the child's transcript carries a
  `LOOP-LEFTOVERS:` line naming it, the item's state record names it, and the report's action list names the
  recovery — so the work is readable after `--reset-worktree` discards the tree
- **Case**: `run#treeOfACapEndedChildIsKeptAsAPatch`

#### Scenario: The item the run's own deadline cut is not a decision

- **WHEN** the run's deadline passes while an item's child is running, and the run ends that child
- **THEN** the item is recorded `blocked` with the `LOOP-TIMEOUT`/`LOOP-DEADLINE` lines of its transcript and its
  tree uncommitted, no decision label is written for it, and the report's decision list does not hold it — the
  item is left for the next run
- **Case**: `run#childIsEndedAtTheRunsDeadline`

#### Scenario: A reviewer the run's deadline cut is not a refusal

The deadline is consulted while a child runs, and a reviewer is a child: its transcript carried the same
`LOOP-DEADLINE` line as the worker's, and no part of the run read it — so a round the clock ended was read as one
the reviewer never answered, which bought a retry and then a rework worker for a change nobody refused, and the
item was escalated with the other blocks.

- **WHEN** the run's deadline passes while the reviewer of a review round is running, and the run ends that child
- **THEN** the round is recorded as cut rather than refused — the transcript's `LOOP-DEADLINE` line is read, no
  retry and no rework worker is started for it, and the item is recorded `blocked` with no decision label and no
  entry in the report's decision list, exactly as the item whose worker the same clock ended
- **Case**: `run#reviewerEndedAtTheRunsDeadlineIsNotADecision`
