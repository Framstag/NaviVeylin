## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: One command starts a budgeted run, with no dialogue

A run SHALL be started by one command whose budget is supplied as arguments and recorded, and SHALL
require no interactive answer, so that the same run can be repeated and audited.

#### Scenario: The budget is arguments, not a prompt

- **WHEN** a run is started
- **THEN** the item cap, the time budget, whether a review is taken and whether closure is allowed are
  arguments whose effective values are recorded and printed in the run's header

#### Scenario: The run stops on its own authority

- **WHEN** the item cap is reached, the time budget is spent, the queue is empty, two items in a row were
  blocked, the remaining time cannot pay for another item, or the host has less available memory than the
  recorded floor
- **THEN** the run stops without needing a further decision

#### Scenario: The floor the run refuses by is what its own items cost

A constant floor could not tell a 100-minute item (#126, 2026-10-19) from a 12-minute one, so it admitted the
first with 45 minutes left and refused 28 minutes of cheap work after it (issue #206).

- **WHEN** the remaining time is compared against the floor, and the run has finished at least one item whose
  wall time it recorded (`done --wall SECONDS`)
- **THEN** the floor is derived from those recorded wall times — their median minutes times the 1.5 spread the
  measured costs show, rounded up to the whole minute — and is never below the configured
  `LOOP_ITEM_FLOOR_MINUTES`, and the refusal names the floor, the median, how many finished items it came from
  and the configured minimum, e.g. `only 28 min left, below the 90 min floor for the next item (median 60 min
  over 3 finished items, configured minimum 45)`
- **Case**: `state#floorIsDerivedFromTheFinishedItemsWallTimes`

#### Scenario: A run with no measurement keeps the configured minimum

- **WHEN** no finished item of the run records a wall time — the run has just started, or every item so far
  was recorded without `--wall`
- **THEN** the floor is the configured `LOOP_ITEM_FLOOR_MINUTES`, and the refusal names that value together
  with the reason no measurement was used, rather than implying a measurement it does not have
- **Case**: `state#floorWithNoHistoryIsTheConfiguredMinimum`

#### Scenario: A child that outlasts the configured wall-clock is ended and recorded

The budget is consulted between items, so a child process is the one place a spent budget could not be
noticed: the run waited for it with no limit, and a gate that never returns could spend the whole run inside
one wait.

- **WHEN** an agent process runs longer than the configured child wall-clock
  (`LOOP_CHILD_MAX_SECONDS`, default 2700 s = 45 min)
- **THEN** the run ends that process and every process it started, appends one machine-readable line to the
  report it was writing (`LOOP-TIMEOUT: the child exceeded <n> s …`), and returns a status that is not the
  child's own, so the item is recorded `blocked` with that transcript and the run goes on to its next stop
  condition instead of spending its clock in one wait
- **Case**: `run#childOutlastingTheWallClockIsBlocked`

#### Scenario: A child that never started is the run's fault, not the item's

A non-zero status alone cannot tell a child whose argv the environment refused from a child that worked the
item and failed: on 2026-10-20 both children of that run died in under 4 s with the same 35-byte complaint,
and the run recorded two items `blocked`, escalated both with `agent/needs-decision` and `status/on-hold`, and
stopped on "two consecutive items ended blocked" 3 minutes into an 8 h budget — two questions nobody had asked, and two
of the run's three decision slots (issue #212).

- **WHEN** an agent process ends with a non-zero status, wrote no verdict line, was not ended by the run's own
  wall-clock, and left the item's tree at the run's base commit
- **THEN** the run records that once as its own stop reason, naming the child's own last line, and stops
  without escalating an item: no item record is written for it, no decision label and no hold reach it, and it
  is left as its owner set it — `status/open` and no `agent/needs-decision` — because no part of it was read
- **Case**: `run#childThatNeverStartedIsTheRunsFault`

#### Scenario: A run is recorded

- **WHEN** a run ends
- **THEN** a report exists naming each item, its verdict, its wall time, its spend, its review rounds and what
  it closed, so the run justifies itself with numbers — every item's row carries the wall time the run recorded
  for it, the tools its children called with their count, the tokens they used with their cost and the largest
  context they reached, and, when the item's result is not a closure, the reason the item recorded, and the
  columns the report already had keep their name and their order
- **Case**: `report#wallTimeAndReasonInTheTable`

#### Scenario: An item's spend is read from the child's own stream

The agent reports its tool calls, its tokens and its cost in its event stream, and the loop used to start it in
a mode that discards the stream, so the one measurement of spend that exists was never read (issue #211).

- **WHEN** a child's process produced an event stream and the item is recorded with it
- **THEN** the item's metrics hold the count of each tool its children called, the tokens they used summed over
  their responses (each response counted once, at its last usage record, not once per streamed update), what
  those tokens cost, and the largest context any of them reached — the biggest input-plus-cache-read of a
  response, or a compaction's `tokensBefore` when the context was compacted — and the row the report prints
  shows them in the `tools`, `tokens` and `context` columns
- **Case**: `run#childUsageIsRecordedPerItem`

#### Scenario: Nothing reported is printed as zero

A provider that streams no usage leaves zeros behind, and a zero in a column of numbers reads as a measurement
that was made.

- **WHEN** an item's stream holds no usage record, holds only zeroed ones, or no stream was written at all —
  a project whose agent command prints plain text is the third case
- **THEN** the report prints `-` in the `tools`, `tokens` and `context` columns rather than `0`, the item is
  worked and recorded exactly as before, and nothing about the run depends on the stream existing
- **Case**: `report#zeroUsagePrintsDashNotZero`, `run#plainTextChildStillReports`

#### Scenario: The report names the actions the caller owes

The report is read instead of the tracker, so a list of ids is not an answer: a decision without its question,
a branch without its owner, a gate without its log and a kept worktree without its path send the caller back
to `gh` to reconstruct what the run already knew (issue #208). A branch is named here by what it **carries**:
the loop lands an item's work as a commit of its own, so a branch whose patches the base already holds has
nothing to land (issue #228).

- **WHEN** a run ends holding a decision it escalated, a branch that carries a patch the run's base does not
  have, a kept worktree, an item whose gate never completed, or a citation the pre-screen refused
- **THEN** the report prints one named action for each: the decision with the question the run wrote beside
  it — or, where the state does not hold that text, where the question is (`gh issue view <n>`) rather than an
  invented one — the branch with the patches it carries and the item that owns it, the kept worktree with its
  path, the item's transcript for the gate that never completed, and the repair command for the refused
  citation
- **Case**: `report#actionsNameDecisionAndBranch`

#### Scenario: A branch whose patches are in the base is not an action

- **WHEN** a run ends and one of the item branches it sees carries no patch the base does not have — every one
  of its commits was landed, or re-landed, as a commit of the loop's own
- **THEN** the action list does not name that branch, and its `none` line is printed when nothing else is owed,
  so a leftover cannot be read as work a caller has to land
- **Case**: `report#landedBranchIsNoAction`

#### Scenario: An action list is empty only when the state says so

- **WHEN** no decision, no branch carrying an unlanded patch, no kept worktree, no incomplete gate and no
  refused citation is recorded — or when the state names any one of them
- **THEN** the report prints the action list heading with `none` and what that covers in the first case, and
  never prints `none` in the second, so an empty list cannot hide a branch that carries work
- **Case**: `report#emptyRunSaysNone`

#### Scenario: The host a run works on is read and named

The budget had no term for the machine: on 2026-10-19 the same 5 680 tests took 3m47s on a quiet host and 30
minutes inside one Gradle task at 194 MB free and 18 GB of swap, so the run's `wallSeconds` measured the
desktop session (issue #209).

- **WHEN** a run is started, and the host publishes the memory it has available in the file the configured
  key names
- **THEN** the run's header prints the available memory in MiB beside the budget and beside the floor it is
  compared against, so a run's numbers can be read against the host it ran on
- **Case**: `run#hostAboveTheFloorRunsTheItem`

#### Scenario: A host below the floor is reported instead of spent

- **WHEN** the available memory read before an item's first agent process is started is below the recorded
  floor (`LOOP_MIN_FREE_MIB`, default 1024 MiB)
- **THEN** no agent process is started and no branch is created for the item, the item is recorded `blocked`
  with the measurement and the floor it was compared against, and the run stops with that shortfall as its
  stop reason — a run on a starved host cannot become productive by taking the next item either
- **Case**: `run#hostBelowTheFloorBlocksTheItemAndStops`

#### Scenario: A host that publishes no reading is not refused

A check that cannot be made is not a refusal: the engine has to run in a container without procfs, or on a
host that keeps the number somewhere else.

- **WHEN** the file the configured key names does not exist, or carries no `MemAvailable` value
- **THEN** the check passes, the item's child is started as it always was, and the header says the reading is
  unavailable instead of inventing a number
- **Case**: `run#hostWithoutTheReadingPasses`

### Requirement: Version control belongs to the run's script, not to the agent

The run SHALL create and manage the working tree and the branch of each item itself, and no phase of an
item SHALL be able to invoke version control on its own behalf. A previous attempt's branch SHALL be decided
by what it carries: a branch whose attempt finished SHALL be merged and its item closed by the run, and only
a branch that carries no finished change SHALL be refused and escalated as a decision. What a branch carries
SHALL be read by **patch identity**, not by ancestry: the run lands an item's work as a commit of its own
(`fix: … (#N)`), so a branch whose work is already on the base is not an ancestor of it and ancestry reads a
finished branch as unlanded work for ever (issue #228).

#### Scenario: One working tree per run

- **WHEN** a run starts
- **THEN** it prepares one working tree for the whole run and seeds it with what the project's build and
  test need, so the cold cost is paid once
- **Case**: `worktree#seedsAllFourInputs`

#### Scenario: One branch per item, from the run's base

- **WHEN** an item starts
- **THEN** it is worked on its own branch from the base commit the run recorded
- **Case**: `worktree#oneBranchPerItemOffTheBase`

#### Scenario: A commit carries the run's own identity

- **WHEN** the run commits an item's work on a machine with no `user.name` or `user.email` configured
- **THEN** both commits carry the identity the run already acts as — the login its own gate preflight
  resolved, as that login's noreply address — so the run never depends on an ambient git identity and never
  invents one, and a login that cannot be resolved stops the run with a named reason
- **Case**: `run#commitsWithoutAnAmbientIdentity`

#### Scenario: A branch that carries no work of its own is reused

- **WHEN** an item starts and a branch of that item's name already exists, and every commit on it is
  already in the run's base history, so the base is an ancestor of it
- **THEN** the item is worked on that branch, started from the run's base, so an item a previous run left
  blocked can be taken up again
- **Case**: `worktree#reusesABranchThatCarriesNoWorkOfItsOwn`

#### Scenario: A branch whose work already landed is reused

- **WHEN** an item starts and a branch of that item's name already exists, and the base carries every patch
  on it although the branch is not an ancestor of the base — the loop's own landing shape, where the work
  arrived as a new commit
- **THEN** the item is worked on that branch, started from the run's base, because a leftover is not a
  previous attempt: nothing on the branch is work the base would lose
- **Case**: `worktree#reusesABranchWhoseWorkAlreadyLanded`

#### Scenario: A branch that carries a previous attempt is refused, named and recorded

- **WHEN** an item's branch carries a commit the run's base does not have — whether the run learns it when the
  item starts, or the pre-screen asks git for it before any item is picked, on the item's branch-name prefix
  because the slug is not known before the title is read — and the branch carries no finished change
- **THEN** the item is refused with the branch and the commits it carries named, and it is recorded as
  awaiting a decision before a budget slot is spent on it — in the run's own exclusion list and on the item,
  with the branch as the evidence — because a previous attempt's work is never thrown away and a refusal is
  never silent
- **Case**: `prescreen#previousAttemptBranchIsADecision`, `run#leftoverBranchIsRecordedNotDropped`

#### Scenario: A landed leftover is not a decision

- **WHEN** the pre-screen meets a branch of the item's name whose every patch the run's base already carries
- **THEN** the item is left eligible: no verdict, no exclusion and no decision slot is spent on a branch that
  holds no unlanded work
- **Case**: `prescreen#landedBranchIsNotADecision`

#### Scenario: A finished attempt's branch is merged and its item closed

- **WHEN** an item's branch carries a commit the run's base does not have, and that branch adds exactly one
  archived change of its own whose verification record is green — learned either when the item starts or when
  the pre-screen records the branch as an exclusion
- **THEN** the branch's commits are merged onto the base, the base the run recorded advances to the merge, the
  item is closed with the branch, its commits and the evidence it was checked for named in the run's own record
  and report, and no budget slot is spent on a fresh attempt — so a finished attempt is not treated as a blocked
  one
- **Case**: `run#mergesAFinishedAttemptAndClosesTheItem`

#### Scenario: A branch without a green verification is not merged

- **WHEN** the run learns of a previous attempt's branch that carries a commit the base does not have but whose
  archived change has no green verification record
- **THEN** the branch is not touched and the refusal names what it looked for, so a blocked attempt's branch is
  neither merged nor closed and its decision stays the owner's
- **Case**: `run#doesNotMergeAnAttemptWithoutAGreenVerification`

#### Scenario: A stale base stops the next item

- **WHEN** the main branch has advanced past the run's base commit
- **THEN** the next item is refused and both commits are named, rather than building on a tree nobody
  reviewed
- **Case**: `worktree#refusesWhenMainAdvanced`

#### Scenario: Nothing is pushed or opened by default

- **WHEN** a run does not ask to publish
- **THEN** no push and no change request happens, whatever the items did
- **Case**: `worktree#noPushWithoutTheFlag`
