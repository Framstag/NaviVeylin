## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A block records the mechanism that stopped it

An item recorded `blocked` SHALL carry the mechanism that stopped it, from a closed vocabulary — `refused` when a
review round refused the change, `unmergeable` when the base would not take the branch — and a block neither
mechanism caused SHALL carry none. A value outside the vocabulary, and a mechanism on a result that is not a
block, SHALL be a usage error before anything is written, so a mechanism's spend is totalled without the note's
prose.

#### Scenario: The refusing round is named

- **WHEN** the last review round at the cap refuses the change and the item is recorded blocked
- **THEN** the item's record carries `refused` as its stop reason, beside the note that names the round
- **Case**: `run#reviewRoundsCapAtTwo`

#### Scenario: The base's refusal is named

- **WHEN** the run cannot merge the item's branch onto the base and the item is recorded blocked
- **THEN** the item's record carries `unmergeable`, beside the note that names the branch
- **Case**: `run#doesNotCloseOnAMergeTheBaseCannotTake`

#### Scenario: A mechanism outside the vocabulary is refused

- **WHEN** a stop reason is given that is neither `refused` nor `unmergeable`, or a stop reason is given for a
  result that is not a block
- **THEN** the record is refused as a usage error and the state is not written, so the field cannot turn into a
  second prose channel
- **Case**: `state#aBlockedItemNamesTheMechanismThatStoppedIt`

#### Scenario: The report tables the mechanism beside the spend

- **WHEN** the run's report prints its per-item table
- **THEN** each row carries the mechanism its block stopped on, or `-` when it carries none, in a column of its
  own, so a mechanism's spend is totalled from the table
- **Case**: `report#wallTimeAndReasonInTheTable`
